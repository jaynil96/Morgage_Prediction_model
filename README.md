# Morgage_Prediction_model
An exploratory look at building a predictive model for Mortgage Prediction on the Boston Loan Data set 
<h2>About</h2>
<ul>
<li> This is an attempt to build a model using the K-Nearest Neighbor Classification Method</li>
<li> For this we are using the Boston loan data set provided by Kaggle</li>
</ul>
<h2> Features </h2>
<ul>
<li> This uses the Scilearns, KNeighbors Classifiers Library </li>
<li> Model will be able to predict the amount of money you can get based on your various features</li>
<li> After examing the data, it was decided to use a K-NN model, however a possible Decision Tree Model may be good think to look into
</ul>
<h2> Notes </h2>
<ul>
<li> This project is not yet complete, as such it will be undergoing rapid changes</li>
<li> As of right now I am examing the data trying to find out which variables causes the most change in loan amount</li>
<li> The goal is to use this variable as the primary variable for the decision tree model, comparing their R2 scores and finding out which
one is more accurate</li>
</ul>
